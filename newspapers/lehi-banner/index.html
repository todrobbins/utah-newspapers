    <p><a href="../../places/lehi/">Lehi, Utah</a>, founded in 1850, was a farming community as well as a stop along the route of the Pony Express. The establishment of the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utah-Idaho_Sugar_Company">Utah Sugar Company</a> in 1890 spurred growth, and the <em>Lehi Banner</em> first appeared on May 29, 1891 as the official newspaper of the new sugar factory. The format of local news, world events and beet-sugar industry analysis attracted readers and advertisers. Local interests continued to dominate its pages for years to come. In 1915 the <em>Banner</em> moved its publishing operation to <a href="../../places/american-fork/">American Fork</a> as a cost-cutting measure. Its competitor, the <em>Lehi Sun</em> bought the <em>Banner</em> in 1917. <a href="https://digitalnewspapers.org/newspaper/?paper=Lehi+Banner"><span>Utah Digital Newspapers</span></a></p>
