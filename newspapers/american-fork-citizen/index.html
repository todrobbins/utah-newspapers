    <p>American Fork's first newspaper, the <em>Weekly Gazette</em>, began in 1868. Interestingly, it was a pen-and-ink manuscript and included items like original poetry, essays, and wit and humor. It was short lived, folding after only 12 editions. The <em>American Fork Independent</em> came along in March 1890 and provided coverage of Utah's mining industry for two years. Several other newspapers came and went until the <em>Citizen</em> appeared May 27, 1903. The newspaper provided citizens of American Fork with a mixture of local and national news, along with light-hearted material. In the summer of 1906 the <em>Citizen</em> included coverage of a visit by President Teddy Roosevelt to the Panama Canal Zone; a how-to-guide on dry farming, and the following: "Four [young girls] surrounded a big black snake the other day and stabbed it to death with hatpins. Oh that Mother Eve had been so courageous----and had possessed a hatpin!" In 1912, the Citizen changed hands and added the name of the town, becoming the American Fork Citizen. In 1979 the paper was absorbed by Utah County's largest newspaper, the <em>Provo Herald</em> which distributes an online edition of the <em>American Fork Citizen</em>. <a href="http://digitalnewspapers.org/newspaper/?paper=American+Fork+Citizen"><span>Utah Digital Newspapers</span></a></p>
