    <p>On September 14, 1895, <a href="../../people/julius-f-taylor">Julius F. Taylor</a> unveiled the <em>Broad Ax</em>, one of a handful of African-American newspapers published in Utah. Taylor was a Democrat who supported the Free Silver wing of the party and tried to convert African-Americans from the Republican Party. The paper's philosophy was: "Will promulgate and at all times uphold the true principles of Democracy, but farmers, Catholics, Protestants, Knights of Labor, Infidels, Mormons, Priests Republicans or anyone else can have their say so long as their language is proper and responsibility is fixed. The Broad Ax is a newspaper whose platform is broad enough for all, ever claiming the editorial right to speak its own mind." <em>The Broad Ax</em> had a running feud with a newspaper called the <em>Plain Dealer</em> and frequently referred to it as the <em>Plain Double-Dealer</em>. <em>The Wasatch Wave</em> described Taylor as a "Bright, intelligent young man." In 1901, Taylor moved the paper to Chicago, where it continued into the 1920s. <a href="https://digitalnewspapers.org/newspaper/?paper=Broad+Ax"><span>Utah Digital Newspapers</span></a></p>
