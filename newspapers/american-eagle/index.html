    <p>The beginnings of <em>The American Eagle</em> of <a href="../../places/murray/">Murray</a>, Utah, are shrouded in mystery. The newspaper may have been published as early as 1891 as the American. Other sources list 1896 as the beginning publication date, before <a href="../../places/murray/">Murray</a> was incorporated in 1903. Issues beginning in 1897 are offered here. <a href="http://digitalnewspapers.org/newspaper/?paper=American+Eagle"><span>Utah Digital Newspapers</span></a></p>
